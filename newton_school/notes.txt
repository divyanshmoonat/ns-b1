In React every component always returns an HTML structure.
For every component to show on UI, you have to write the name of the function in pascal case ie Start with a Captial letter eg App, Header etc

Any class of function which returns HTML structure is called a component.

My function redefined

myFunctionRedefined => Camel Case

MyFunctionRedefined => Pascal Case

my_function_redefined => Snake Case


<div class="article"></div> => HTML version
<div className="article"></div> => React version

React doesn't allows a tag to remain open even not an empty tag.

If it is a component, for every js file we'll write a CSS file.

JSX (JavaScript and XML)

Webpack : Module bundler (bundle.js)

https://babeljs.io/
https://webpack.js.org/

"AVOID RUNNING eject COMMAND"


Imperative Way: This way says write and how every thing step by step in the code.
Declarative Way: This way says focus on the output rather than shownig things step by step.

// const arr = [3, 1, 2, 76, 3, 65];
// Imperative way
// let max = 0;
// for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
//   if (max < arr[i]) {
//     max = arr[i];
//   }
// }
// console.log(max);

// Declarative way
// console.log(Mat=h.max.apply(this, arr));

Props (Properties) : Arguments which are passed to a component (function/class based).
Conditional Rendering : Showing UI based on some basic conditions

Anything other than plain text should be written in side {} in JSX.

By passing function as a prop : 

1. Capture the user input in Events component
2. Pass the user input to App component
3. Event will store it into state variable
4. Re-render
