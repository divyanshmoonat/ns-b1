In React every component always returns an HTML structure.
For every component to show on UI, you have to write the name of the function in pascal case ie Start with a Captial letter eg App, Header etc

Any class of function which returns HTML structure is called a component.

My function redefined

myFunctionRedefined => Camel Case

MyFunctionRedefined => Pascal Case

my_function_redefined => Snake Case


<div class="article"></div> => HTML version
<div className="article"></div> => React version

React doesn't allows a tag to remain open even not an empty tag.

If it is a component, for every js file we'll write a CSS file.

JSX (JavaScript and XML)

Webpack : Module bundler (bundle.js)
